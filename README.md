After pulling from Github and adding the project, make sure to add the JSON library. It is located in the /lib subfolder.
To do this:
  - Right click on the project and click Properties, or highlight the project and go to File -> Properties
  - Go to Java Build Path
  - Click the Add Jars button
  - Find the JSON library inside the /lib folder, and add it
  - All JSON will work from this point
